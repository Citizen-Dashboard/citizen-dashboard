      "This report provides recommendations on an Imagination, Manufacturing, Innovation and Technology Program application for a film studio complex known as Basin Media Studios in the Port Lands, an area in Ward 14 (Toronto – Danforth). The application was submitted by Hackman Capital Partners and CreateTO on May 24, 2023, and is subject to the City-Wide Community Improvement Plan, By-law 1207-2018, which was the bylaw in effect at the time of application. The applicant has also applied for the Brownfield Remediation Tax Assistance incentive.By-law 1207-2018 states that City Council approval is required in cases where an application for Development Grants has an estimated construction value for the development exceeding $150 million. Due to the potential financial implications to the City of approving an Imagination, Manufacturing, Innovation and Technology Program application for a project of this size, the City contracted with Hemson Consulting Limited. to provide a third-party review and detailed analysis of the subject applications (Attachment 2). For the reasons detailed in this report, staff recommends the approval of the application for 29, 35, 41 and 75 Basin Street.\n",
      "In the fourth quarter of 2024, a new City-wide Community Improvement Plan for a Financial Incentive Program consisting of development grants will be brought forward to City Council. Until any new City-Wide Community Improvement Plan by-law is approved and in force, applications received under the existing program will continue to be considered and processed under the applicable in-force by-law at the date of the application’s receipt.\n",
